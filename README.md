Abstract:

In assessing the environmental impacts of energy transition technologies, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) practitioners typically rely on aggregated data for upstream processes related to raw material production. This reliance introduces significant uncertainty. Recent studies have coupled remote sensing with mine production data to calculate mine-specific land transformation and biogenic carbon loss emission factors, revealing wide variability. However, these studies use cumulative production over limited time frames, making direct comparison and integration with Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) databases such as Ecoinvent difficult, since LCIs report land transformation relative to lifetime cumulative production.
In this study I estimated lifetime cumulative production using the Hubbert model based on primary commodity data from SNL Metals and Mining Database and integrated these calculations with spatial mining polygons to derive mine specific land transformation and biogenic carbon loss emission factors. The study covered 538 mines across 64 countries covering key energy transition metals including aluminium, copper, iron, lithium, manganese, nickel and zinc. This study shows that impacts vary across several orders of magnitude between mines with open pit mines generally showing higher impacts than underground mines. Brine-based lithium stands out with a median land transformation factor of 5.41e-01 m²/kg. Copper also exhibits high values (1.22e-04 to 2.89e+00 m²/kg), while iron shows the lowest intensities but the largest spread (2.44e-07 to 1.24e-02 m²/kg). Comparison with Ecoinvent reveals that database averages can misrepresent mine-level impacts, in some cases by more than an order of magnitude. For example, Ecoinvent underestimates the median land transformation values of brine-based lithium, open-pit iron, and open-pit zinc by factors of 106, 116, and 39, respectively. Biogenic carbon loss emissions vary strongly by geography, with mines in tropical and temperate forest regions exhibiting the highest intensities, often surpassing Scope 1 operational emissions reported in Ecoinvent by more than an order of magnitude.
These findings suggest that LCA’s should incorporate geographic data wherever possible. Reliance on generic averages risks underestimating the footprint of energy transition metals and by extension, the technologies that depend on them. To address this, policy frameworks should mandate standardized disclosure of spatially explicit, GIS-compatible mine data to improve LCA accuracy and support more transparent monitoring of land impacts.

Research Question: What are the spatially derived land transformation and biogenic carbon impacts of mining activities for aluminium, copper, iron, lithium, manganese, nickel, tin and zinc, and how do they differ from those reported in commercially available life cycle inventory databases? 

Objectives: (i) calculate mine-specific land transformation and biogenic carbon loss emission factors based on lifetime cumulative production, ensuring their comparability and integration with LCI databases such as Ecoinvent; (ii) assess the variability of these mine-specific factors; and (iii) evaluate their divergence from the corresponding values reported in the Ecoinvent database.
